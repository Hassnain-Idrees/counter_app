# To-Do List App

A simple Flutter app designed to help you organize your tasks effectively.  
With its intuitive interface, you can add tasks, view them in a list, and save them for future use—even after restarting the app.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Add tasks using a text input field and an "Add" button.  
- **View Tasks:** See all your tasks displayed in a clean, scrollable list.  
- **Save Tasks:** Tasks are stored locally using SharedPreferences so they remain after closing the app.  
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove any task with a single tap.

## How It Works

1. Type a task into the input field.  
2. Tap **Add** to save it.  
3. Tasks appear in a list below in the order they were added.  
4. The app automatically saves and reloads tasks every time you open it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install the **Flutter SDK** on your system.

### Steps to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hassnain-Idrees/counter_app.git
   cd counter_app
