To-Do List App
This is a simple Flutter app designed to help you organize your tasks effectively. With its intuitive interface, you can add tasks, view them in a list, and ensure they’re saved for future use—even after restarting the app.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add tasks using a text input field and an "Add" button.
View Tasks: See all your tasks displayed in a clean, scrollable list.
Save Tasks: Your tasks are stored locally using SharedPreferences, ensuring they are accessible the next time you open the app.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list with a single tap when they’re no longer needed.
How It Works
Type your task into the input field and press "Add."
Your tasks are displayed below in the order they’re added.
The app saves your tasks automatically and retrieves them whenever you restart it.
